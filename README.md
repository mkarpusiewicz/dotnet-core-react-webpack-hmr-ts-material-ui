# .NET Core React sample project
A setup for .NET Core React application with webpack/babel transpiling with hot module reload, typescript support and Material-UI:
 - ReactJS.NET support
 - React, ReactDOM (UMD loaded)
 - Typescript
 - Webpack with babel setup (Hot module reload with webpack dev server)
 - LESS compiling
 - Material-UI
 - Gulp script to copy UMD scripts from node_modules
 - gulp, npm and other scripts bound to build steps
 
 # Why?
Because I was setuping webpack and react for the first time and it wasn't the easiest for me so I created this boilerplate to reuse in future if it'll be needed.

# Disclamer
I know it's not the best setup and it's missing a lot, if you want to fix something feel free to submit a PR or send me a message.
